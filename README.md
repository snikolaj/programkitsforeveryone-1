# programkitsforeveryone-1
The first release of the ProgramKitsForEveryone project!
ProgramKitsForEveryone is a project where a kit will be released that contains an example program, and a guide on how it works, how to expand it and how to design and build that kind of program. It's meant as a supplement to tutorials and a way for self-taught programmers to learn tips and tricks that are learned through experience and usually not taught. You don't even need to use the example project, though it will make the attached writeup make more sense. Requires basic knowledge of the Godot game engine.
